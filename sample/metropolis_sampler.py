    Description
    ------
    1. A sampler by Metropolis algorithm.
    
    2. The priori distribution is Gaussian.
    
    2.1 The "priori" is the proposed transition distribution. This terminology
        follows Metropolis et al (1953), indicating that this distribution
        is given before discriminating on the target_distribution.
    
    3. C.f. _An Introduction to MCMC for Machine Learning_, section 3.1.
    
    4. What is `gibbs` meaning for??? In practice, it does increases accepted
       ratio. But I do not know why.
    
    Inputs
    ------
    target_distribution:
        Any n-dimensional distribution. That is, any integratible non-negative
        function from $\mathbb{R}^n$ to $\mathbb{R}$.
    
    sigma:
        The sigma in the Gaussian proposed transition distribution.
    
    init_vector:
        Any vector in $\mathbb{R}^n$ in the support of the target_distribution.
    
    burn_in:
        We drop out all accepted samples before value of burn_in.
    
    gibbs:
        If `True`, then the Markov process obeys the Gibbs sampling. Else not.
    
    Output
    ------
    [(sample_0, target_distribution(sample_0)),
     (sample_1, target_distribution(sample_1)),
     ...
     ]
    
    where sample_i is a n-dimensional vector.
