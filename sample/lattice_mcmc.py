To-do
------
Needs optimization: when rejected while the new position does be higher than
that I'm standing on, this position shall be recorded in RAM, until in several
steps later my position becomes higher than it.


Description
---------
This is a little module of bared MCMC algorithm, used for computing the maximum
value of any given function on any given range OF LATTICE in any given dimension
(for precise definition, see below).

This follows: https://github.com/Jverma/mcmc/blob/master/mcmc.py (c.f. also
https://github.com/Jverma/mcmc/blob/master/fitness.py)


Lattice and Position
---------
A n-dimensional lattice, depending on n positive integers `[N_1, ..., N_n]`,
is a list of positions; each position is of the form

    [x_1, x_2, ..., x_n]

where x_i is in range(N_i). The lattice, then, is a list of ALL such positions.


Parallel Computation of Chains
---------
CAUTION: When the number of chains is large, please avoid setting
        `parallelQ = True` in `mcmc`!

Parallel computation does be faster, but when the number of chains is large
enough, the `Pool` crashes. I have met this situation.

Remark that the map of Python3 (not parallel_map) effectively slows down the
computation. You shall employ `[f(_) for _ in x_list]` instead!

                                
Test Result
---------
It is found that the `tolerence` shall NOT be large. E.g. for the tests in the
end of this file:
    
    1. if set `tolerence, max_break_counter = 0.01, 30`, the chain won't move at
       all, since the threshold of moving is high and thus it's easy to reach
       the `max_break_counter`;
       
    2. so is setting `tolerence, max_break_counter = 0.1, 300`;
    
    3. if set `tolerence, max_break_counter = 0.1, 3000`, the chain moves for
       for quite a long time;
       
    4. if set `tolerence, max_break_counter = 0.01, 300`, the chain moves (for
       for quite a long time) and then returns the correct result;
    
    5. if set `tolerence, max_break_counter = 0.001, 30`, the chain moves and
       then returns the correct result, very quickly.
       
So, we find:
    
    1. for relatively large `tolerence`, the chain won't move since the
       threshold of moving is high and thus it's easy to reach the
       `max_break_counter`;
       
    2. even though, tuning `max_break_counter` to be larger solves this problem,
       it will take quite a long time to run.
       
    3. for relatively small `tolerence`, the chain moves return the correct
       result quickly, without a relatively large `max_break_counter`.
       
So, the safe and economic setting is using a relatively small but still
non-vanishing `tolerence`.

        position alters when, at the next position, the relative gain
        of function exceeds `tolerence * random()`. This threshold

    max_break_counter:

    1. Position on lattice is altered ONlY when it gains a greater value of
       function.
    2. If it stays in one position for quite a long time (determined by
       `max_break_counter`), then break the iteration and finish the chain.
